# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities. Which versions are eligible for receiving such patches depends on the CVSS v3.0 Rating:

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Postium Mail seriously. If you have discovered a security vulnerability in our project, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability?

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to:
- Primary: security@postium-mail.example.com (replace with actual email)
- Secondary: Create a private security advisory on GitHub

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

### What to Expect

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours, we will acknowledge receipt of your report
- **Assessment**: Within 7 days, we will provide an initial assessment of the vulnerability
- **Fix Timeline**: We will work on a fix and provide you with an estimated timeline
- **Disclosure**: We will coordinate with you on the disclosure of the vulnerability

### Security Update Process

1. The security team will investigate the vulnerability
2. A fix will be developed and tested
3. A new version will be released with the security patch
4. A security advisory will be published

## Third-Party Dependencies

We regularly update our dependencies to ensure we're using the latest secure versions:

- **Frontend Dependencies**: Managed via npm/yarn with regular audits
- **Backend Dependencies**: Managed via Cargo with security audits
- **Automated Scanning**: Dependabot enabled for automatic security updates

To check for vulnerabilities in dependencies:

```bash
# Frontend
yarn audit
npm audit

# Backend
cd src-tauri
cargo audit
```

## Responsible Disclosure

We kindly ask you to:

1. **Give us time to fix the issue** before public disclosure
2. **Not exploit the vulnerability** beyond what's necessary for your report
3. **Not share the vulnerability** with others until it's fixed
4. **Provide sufficient detail** to reproduce and fix the issue

In return, we commit to:

1. **Acknowledge your contribution** (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
2. **Keep you informed** about the progress of fixing the vulnerability
3. **Credit you** in our security advisory (with your permission)
